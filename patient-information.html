        <div class="dropdown">
          <span class="dropdown-title">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</span>
          <div class="dropdown-list hidden">
            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a high quality method of imaging the interior of the body using the effect of magnetic waves on hydrogen protons. During varying periods and intensities of magnetization of hydrogen, the molecules align. Observing the relaxation time of the molecules after the magnet is turned off (the time it takes for the molecules to return to their normal orientation), a radio frequency wave is used to gather information and translated by a computer to produce a detailed visual image.</p>
            <p>MRI is an excellent modality for the evaluation of soft tissue, since these tissues contain the most hydrogen. MRI is good at imaging bone as well.</p>
            <p>Contrast agents, such as gadolinium can be used with MRI to detect tumors and their composition, inflammation, and to evaluate changes due to surgery and infection.</p>

        <div class="dropdown">
          <span class="dropdown-title">Computed Tomography (CT)</span>
          <div class="dropdown-list hidden">
            <p>Computed tomography (CT) is a high quality method of imaging the interior of the body using X-rays (ionizing radiation). A tomogram is a slice or section image produced using a wave, in this case generated by gamma radiation. The resulting data is translated by a computer into visual images based upon the amount of radiation blocked by each type of structure in the body.</p>
            <p>CT is an excellent modality for imaging bone. It is adequate for soft tissue evaluation, but is surpassed in most areas by MRI. Contrast, usually ionic radiopaque contrast, can be used to highlight tumors, infection, and inflammation or to delineate findings on a non-contrast scan.</p>
            <p>CT is a common scan performed when a patient is unable to undergo MRI exam (i.e. pacemaker, surgical clips, cochlear implants).</p>

          <span class="dropdown-title">CT/Myelogram (uncommonly used)</span>
          <div class="dropdown-list hidden">
            <p>Myelography, with or without CT, is a technique of visualizing the spinal canal by injection of radiopaque contrast into the canal. In spine applications, CT scan almost always follows myelography in order to obtain the most detailed information. MRI has largely replaced CT myelogram, however in post op patients whose hardware obscures visualization under MRI, or who cannot undergo an MRI, CT myelogram remains a useful modality.</p>

          <span class="dropdown-title">Nuclear Bone Scan</span>
          <div class="dropdown-list hidden">
            <p>Nuclear bone scan (or scintigraphy) is an imaging technique that utilizes bony uptake of a nuclear isotope to produce images of the skeleton. An isotope (i.e. Technicium99) is introduced via an intravenous line, and the patient waits for 2-3 hours for the isotope to be taken up by bone cells. A scintigraph or a computed tomogram is then obtained to create visual images of the skeleton.  Because isotope uptake is based on osteoblastic (growth) activity, areas of increased bone activity results in increased isotope uptake. Areas of decreased bone activity or destruction result in decreased uptake. Both types of uptake can indicate disease states.</p>
            <p>Nuclear bone scans are useful in detecting subtle bone damage or fracture. Bone scan is also useful as a screening tool for determining metastatic activity of some types of cancer.</p>

          <span class="dropdown-title">Labeled White Cell Scan (Tc99 or Gallium67)</span>
          <div class="dropdown-list hidden">
            <p>Labeled white cell scans are useful in detecting infection in bone, joints and soft tissue. Blood is obtained from the patient via venipuncture. This blood is separated, and the white blood cells are mixed with the isotope of choice, and returned to the patient. Scintigraphy or bone scan is then performed in two phases. The first phase scan is performed soon after the labeling procedure. A second scan is performed 4 to 6 hours later.</p>
            <p>This type of scan is very effective for detecting infections in the limbs (Tc99), and the spine (gallium67).</p>

          <div class="dropdown-list hidden">
            <p>Plain X-ray or radiography is an imaging technique that utilizes ionizing radiation caught on a wave sensitive plate to image the human body, especially the skeleton.</p>
            <p>Plain X-ray is analogous to standard photography in that a wave source is used to create an image on a sensitive plate. The body part to be evaluated is exposed to a directional beam of low-level ionizing radiation, positioned over an exposure plate. The plate is then developed chemically or electronically to produce an image.</p>
            <p>X-ray is useful for imaging the skeleton, but is also used for imaging some soft tissues with the addition of contrast.  X-ray is commonly used to evaluate for bony fractures, alignment problems, abnormal motion, and degenerative disease. It is also used for post-op evaluation of surgical hardware and fusion mass.</p>

          <div class="dropdown-list hidden">
            <p>Selective nerve root block (SNRB) is a procedure designed to provide both diagnostic and therapeutic information about pain emanating from a radicular nerve. Some practitioners also call this procedure a selective epidural.</p>
            <p>Under live and intermittent fluoroscopy a needle is placed adjacent to the target nerve as it exits the spine through the corresponding foramen. After placement verification using radiopaque contrast, a small amount of medication is then placed along the course of the nerve. For diagnostic purposes the medication used is a short acting local anesthetic. If therapeutic effect is also desired, a small amount of steroid may be injected concurrently to decrease inflammation and provide long-term pain relief.</p>
            <p>An initial report is obtained from the patient concerning the change in their pain post-injection compared to pre-injection. A second report is obtained 1 – 2 weeks later.</p>
            <p>SNRB is useful diagnostically when there is uncertainty about the involvement of a specific nerve root in the cause of spine and extremity pain.</p>

The procedure is performed with the patient awake but sedated so that immediate pain reports may be obtained as each disc is injected. In addition to injected suspected painful discs, one normal appearing disc is selected as a control. Painless injection of the control disc is necessary to obtain a diagnostically valid discogram.</p>
            <p>Following the discogram, a CT is often obtained to evaluate the morphology of the suspect discs.</p>

          <div class="dropdown-list hidden">
            <p>EMG is a test that evaluates electrical activity within skeletal muscle. Muscles emit signals that vary depending upon the state of the muscle fibers (e.g. relaxation and contraction).  Various disease states can cause changes in these patterns that are detectable via EMG. EMG can also localize the cause of muscle weakness due to nerve impingement or damage.</p>
            <p>EMG is performed by inserting a fine needle into a specific muscle and observing the response as the needle is inserted. Then the muscle is observed while at rest. Finally the patient is asked to contract the muscle, and the activity is again observed. The needle is relocated and the procedure repeated until a sufficient number of motor units have been observed.</p>
            <p>EMG is useful in the diagnosis of many musculoskeletal and neurologic diseases, such as herniated disc, peripheral neuropathy.</p>
