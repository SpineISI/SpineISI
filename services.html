        ISI Philosophy
      </div>
      <p>The Intermountain Spine Institute introduced the concept of multi-disciplinary spine care to the intermountain west in 1990. We approach spine care from a holistic point of view, combining state of the art medical techniques with emphasis on physical and emotional well being. The result is that patients receive the tools that allow them to manage their own care for life, rather than providing short term relief for a particular episode.</p>
